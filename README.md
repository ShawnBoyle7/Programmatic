Programmatic is a developer's curriculum platform.  

We set out to help those who struggle to solidify an understanding of abstract computer science and programming concepts, by breaking them down with thorough but succinct courses, lessons, and visualizations.  

You can personalize your own learning path to set clear goals for your aspirations as a developer.
In your path, you can add a course or a specific lesson that you plan to complete, which you can check as complete when you're done!
